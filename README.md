# springweb
This is a Spring Boot application. It uses Thymeleaf framework work to take the data taken from a Joyo file which takes data 
from the respositories of data. It always uses controllers to set up the mapping to locally hosted html files to display the data.
Finally the data created in DevBootStrap is loaded into the Framework by JRA.
